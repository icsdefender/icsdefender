        <h1>ICS Security</h1>
        <p>Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are used to control and monitor industrial processes. They are critical for the operation of infrastructure such as power plants, water treatment facilities, and manufacturing lines.</p>
        <h2>Importance of ICS Security</h2>
        <p>Security in ICS is crucial because these systems control essential services and infrastructure. A security breach can lead to operational disruptions, safety hazards, and significant economic impacts.</p>
        <h2>Tips for Increasing ICS Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Regularly update and patch all ICS software and hardware components.</li>
            <li>Implement strong network segmentation to isolate ICS from other networks.</li>
            <li>Use strong, unique passwords and change them regularly.</li>
            <li>Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.</li>
            <li>Train employees on security best practices and awareness.</li>
            <li>Use intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities.</li>
